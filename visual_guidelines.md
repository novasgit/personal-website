# Website Visual Identity Guideline: Warm Faceted Topography

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document defines the visual language for the personal website encompassing portfolio, consulting, blog, and personal interests (travel, nature, geography, tech).

The chosen style is **"Warm Faceted Topography."**

**Concept:** This style is a visual metaphor for intersecting disciplines. It bridges the organic, grounded world of geography and nature with the structured, precise world of technology and data. It rejects cold, "corporate tech blues" in favor of a warm, inviting, yet engineered aesthetic.

**Keywords:** Engineered Nature, Low-Poly Geology, Warmth, Precision, Glowing Data, Structural, Grounded.

## 2. Core Visual Pillars

These three principles must be present in every major visual asset.

### Pillar A: The Structural Earth (Form)
Nature is not soft here; it is engineered. Landscapes, mountains, and canyons must be rendered in a **low-poly, faceted style**.
* **Must use:** Straight edges, flat geometric planes, chiseled forms, origami-like folds.
* **Must avoid:** Smooth gradients, rounded corners, soft organic blobs, "bubbly" shapes.

### Pillar B: The Warm Data Glow (Contrast)
Technology and data are represented as light sources cutting through the matte earth.
* **The rule:** The "earth" elements are matte and opaque. The "tech" elements (data streams, graphs, pipelines, UI buttons) are glowing and translucent.
* **The effect:** High contrast between the grounded landscape and the energetic data.

### Pillar C: The Topographic Foundation (Context)
The background aesthetic grounds the site in geography.
* **Usage:** Subtle, thin topographic contour lines used as background patterns or textures on flat surfaces. They should never dominate; they provide context.

## 3. Color Palette

The palette is strictly limited to warm earth tones and incandescent highlights. **Do not use cool blues, greens, or pure black/white.**

### Primary Tones (The Landscape)
Used for large facets, mountains, containers, and structural elements.
* **Deep Terracotta:** `#A65E44` (Shadows, deep structure)
* **Warm Ochre:** `#D99A6C` (Mid-tones, main facets)
* **Muted Sandstone:** `#E6BFA3` (Highlights on facets)

### Accent Tones (The Data Glow)
Used for CTAs, data streams, graphs, and glowing edges.
* **Molten Gold:** `#FFD700` (Primary glow, high energy)
* **Hot Amber:** `#FFAA5E` (Secondary glow, pathways)

### Neutral & Background
* **Background Beige:** `#F2E8DC` (Main page background, very subtle warmth)
* **Text Dark Brown:** `#4A3B32` (For body text and headings—never pure black)

## 4. Typography Guidelines

The typography should balance engineering precision with readability.

* **Headings (H1-H3):** A geometric, sans-serif font with structural integrity. It should feel constructed.
    * *Suggested Fonts:* Montserrat, Space Grotesk, or Inter (Bold weights).
* **Body Text:** A clean, highly readable humanist sans-serif that doesn't look sterile.
    * *Suggested Fonts:* Open Sans, Source Sans Pro, or Roboto.

## 5. Asset Generation Prompts (For AI Agent)

When generating specific image types, use these structural constraints.

### A. Hero Images & Large Conceptual Illustrations
These should be expansive scenes setting the tone for a page (e.g., Homepage, Consulting Services).

* **Perspective:** Isometric view preferred for depth.
* **Prompt structure:** "Isometric illustration in a warm faceted topography style. A [subject, e.g., data pipeline] is depicted as a [metaphor, e.g., glowing river] cutting through a landscape of [low-poly terracotta mountains and chiseled canyons]. The style uses straight edges, geometric planes, and a color palette of ochre, deep orange, and glowing gold. The background is a soft beige with subtle topographic contour lines."

### B. Diagrams & Data Visualization
Used for explaining processes or showcasing stats (as seen in the previous examples).

* **Key Instruction:** Data points must glow. The structure holding the data must be matte earth.
* **Prompt structure:** "A 3D data visualization in a warm faceted topography style. [Describe the chart type, e.g., a bar chart] where the bars are rising hexagonal pillars of glowing gold light, emerging from a chiseled, low-poly base of warm ochre stone. Labels are floating and glowing. High contrast between the glowing data and the matte landscape."

### C. Icons & Spot Illustrations
Small visuals for feature lists or blog headers.

* **Style:** Minimalist 3D renders.
* **Prompt structure:** "A single, minimalist 3D icon of a [subject, e.g., cloud server] rendered in a warm faceted style. It is a geometric, chiseled object made of terracotta, with a subtle internal golden glow on its edges. No complex background."

## 6. UI Design Application

How to apply this style to the actual website interface.

* **Backgrounds:** Use the solid "Background Beige" (`#F2E8DC`). Overlay very faint (10-15% opacity) topographic contour line SVG patterns in a slightly darker beige.
* **Cards & Containers:** Do not use flat white boxes. Use the "Muted Sandstone" (`#E6BFA3`) for card backgrounds. Give them a slight, hard-edged bevel or chiseled drop shadow to imply depth, rather than a soft, blurry shadow.
* **Buttons (CTAs):** Primary action buttons should look like the "glowing data" elements. Use a gradient from Hot Amber to Molten Gold, perhaps with a subtle inner glow effect.

| DO | DON'T |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DO** use straight edges and geometric facets. | **DON'T** use rounded corners or soft blobs. |
| **DO** stick strictly to the warm earth palette. | **DON'T** introduce standard "tech blues" or cool tones. |
| **DO** make data and tech elements glow. | **DON'T** make the landscape elements glow. |
| **DO** use isometric perspectives for depth. | **DON'T** use flat 2D corporate art styles. |
| **DO** use subtle contour lines in backgrounds. | **DON'T** let backgrounds become cluttered or noisy. |
